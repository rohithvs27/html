                <p>When a company decides to fund an idea of establishing or extending an industrial project such as
                    manufacturing units, construction, or other infrastructures, <strong>Project Finance</strong> is the
                    top pursued solution. Due to the capital-intensive nature of such projects, most companies in their
                    nascent stage, find it nearly impossible to fund the project entirely on their own. <strong>Project
                        Finance</strong> comes to their rescue, offering long-term debt finance that comprises of a
                    restricted or non-recourse financial composition arranged against the forecasted cash flow,
                    materializing from the project, with only the project assets held as collateral. The process of
                    obtaining <strong>Project
                        Finance</strong>requires the investor to form a ‘Special Purpose Vehicle’. SPV is an
                    economic entity, run to design, build, and manage the financials of that specific project, thereby
                    guaranteeing lenders of its robust financial health. It’s is a time-tested technique of funding
                    large, risky, and developing industrial projects.&nbsp;</p>


                <h4>Key advantages of Project Finance in Industrial Projects:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Risk Distribution: Funding Industrial Projects through<strong>Project
                            Finance</strong></a> allows investors to divide the project risks among the SPV
                        stakeholders that are financially able of withstanding the risks. Moreover, since the equity
                        commitment is lower than the estimated project budget, a substantial chunk of the risk is
                        transferred to the creditor.</li>
                    <li>Off-Balance sheet or restricted recourse: Project Financing allows debt finance to be disbursed
                        off-balance sheet. Capital and interest repayment are sourced solely from cash flow generated
                        from the project earnings. Thus, if the borrower defaults repayment, the lender can only claim
                        assets of the responsible SPV, and nothing that is not part of that SPV, even if they fall short
                        in value versus the amount owed.</li>
                    <li>Superior tax treatment: Once <strong>Project
                            Finance</strong></a> is availed; the borrower can enjoy the fruits of superior tax
                        treatment. Hence, this is the most sought-after solution for funding long-term projects</li>
                    <li>Impact of sponsor credit on a project: Not only this financing structure optimizes project
                        leverage, but it also makes sure that the creditworthiness of the sponsor does not have an ill
                        effect on the project.</li>
                </ul>

                        <h4>Financing an industrial project goes typically through the following 3 stages:</h4>

                        <p><strong>Pre-Finance stage:</strong> This stage involves realizing the project plan to be
                            pursued basis business needs and market trends followed by a detailed analysis of the risks
                            involved and concluding if the project is technically, politically, economically, and
                            ecologically viable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Financing stage:</strong> In this stage, the sponsor as an SPV avails equity and loan
                            from financial bodies and arrives at a mutually documented agreement of the payment terms
                            and the loan amount, which is then injected into the SPV to finance the project. The
                            disbursement takes place with a mix of debt and equity with a ratio generally of 70:30 (may
                            vary from case to case). After Project financing is complete it enters the financial close
                            stage</p>

                        <p><strong>Post-Financing stage: </strong>Once the project is fully financed, the project-cycle
                            and its milestones are kept under close watch and pushed for completion ahead of the
                            ascertained deadline. Upon project completion, the loans are paid off through the project
                            earnings.</p>
                        <h5>What does the future of Industrial Project Finance look like?</h5>

                        <p>India so far has witnessed many successful completions of infrastructural projects through
                            <strong>Project
                                Finance</strong> such as roadways, airports, power plants, mines, etc. With
                            ample backing from the Indian Government, a rise in the implementation of massive projects
                            especially those associated with urban development can be expected to grow by approximately
                            75% in 2030. Offshore lending is being liberalized too, to open up more financial sources as
                            against the predominant Indian Banks. A steep increase in the demand for Project Financing
                            can be hence forecasted pointing towards an economic boom.</p>
