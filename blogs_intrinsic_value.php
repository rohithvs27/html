                <h2>What is Intrinsic Value?</h2>
                <p>The intrinsic value of a business (or any investment security) is the present value of all expected
                    future cash flows Statement of Cash Flows The Statement of Cash Flows (also referred to as the cash
                    flow
                    statement) is one of the three key financial statements that report the
                    cash, discounted at the appropriate discount rate. Unlike relative
                    forms of valuation that look at comparable companies Comparable Company Analysis This guide shows
                    you step-by-step how to build comparable
                    company analysis ("Comps") and includes a free template and many
                    examples., intrinsic valuation looks only at the inherent value of
                    a business on its own.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/intrinsic-value-1.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

                <p>Another way to define intrinsic value is simply, “The price a rational investor is willing to pay for
                    an investment, given its level of risk.”</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Benjamin Graham and Warrant Buffett are widely considered the forefathers of value investing, which
                    is based on the intrinsic valuation method. Graham’s book, The Intelligent Investor</a>, laid the
                    groundwork for Warren Buffett
                    and the entire school of thought on the topic.</p>
                <p>The term intrinsic means <em>the essential nature of something</em>. Synonyms include innate,
                    inherent, native, natural, deep-rooted, etc.</p>
                <h3>Intrinsic Value Formula</h3>
                <p>There are different variations of the intrinsic value formula but the most “standard” approach is
                    similar to the net present valueNet Present Value (NPV)Net Present Value (NPV) is the value of all
                    future cash flows
                    (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to the
                    present.formula.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/blog/intrinsic-value-2.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

                <p>Where:</p>
                <p><strong>NPV</strong> = Net Present Value</p>
                <p><strong>FV<em><sub>j</sub></em></strong> = Net cash flow for the <em>j</em> th period (for the
                    initial “Present” cash flow, <em>j =</em> 0</p>
                <p><em><strong>i</strong> </em>= annual interest rate</p>
                <p><em><strong>n</strong> </em>= number of periods included</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Variations include multi-stage growth models and assigning a probability or level of certainty to the
                    cash flows and playing around with the discount rate.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Risk Adjusting the Intrinsic Value</h3>
                <p>The task of risk adjusting the cash flows is very subjective and a combination of both art and
                    science.</p>
                <p>There are two main methods:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Discount rate</strong> – Using a discount rate that includes a risk premium in it to
                        adequately discount the cash flows</li>
                    <li><strong>Certainty factor</strong> – Using a factor on a scale of 0-100% certainty of the cash
                        flows in the forecast materializing (This approach is believed to be used by Warren Buffett.
                        Learn more by reading Buffett’s annual letters to shareholders)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Discount Rate</h3>

                <p>In the discount rate approach, a financial analyst will typically use a company’s weighted average
                    cost of capital (WACC). The formula for WACC includes the risk-free rate (usually a government bond
                    yield) plus a premium based on the volatility of the stock multiplied by an equity risk premium.
                    Learn all about the WACC formula here.
                </p>
                <p>The rationale behind this approach is that if a stock is more volatile, it’s a riskier investment.
                    Therefore, a higher discount rate is used, which has the effect of reducing the value of cash flow
                    that would be received further in the future (because of the greater uncertainty).</p>
                <h3>Certainty Factor</h3>
                <p>A certainty factor, or probability, can be assigned to each individual cash flow or multiplied
                    against the entire net present value (NPV) of the business as a means of discounting the investment.
                    In this approach, only the risk-free rate is used as the discount rate, since the cash flows are
                    already risk-adjusted.</p>
                <p>For example, the cash flow from a US Treasury note comes with a 100% certainty attached to it, so the
                    discount rate is equal to yield, say 2.5% in this example. Compare that to the cash flow from a very
                    high-growth and high-risk technology company. A 50% probability factor is assigned to the cash flow
                    from the tech company and the same 2.5% discount rate is used.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, both methods are attempting to do the same thing – to discount an investment
                    based on the level of risk inherent in it.</p>
                <h3>Calculating Intrinsic Value in Excel</h3>
                <p>Below we will provide examples of how to calculate the intrinsic value in Excel using the two methods
                    described above.</p>
                <h4>1. Discount Rate</h4>
                <p>In the screenshot below, you can see how this approach is taken in Excel. The risk-adjusted discount
                    rate for this investment is determined to be 10.0% based on its historic price volatility. In this
                    method, there is no certainty or probability factor assigned to each cash flow, since the discount
                    rate does all the risk adjusting.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/img/blog/intrinsic-value-3.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                <p>As you will see, for an investment that pays $10,000 at the end of each year for 10 years with a 10%
                    discount rate, the intrinsic value is $61,446.</p>

                    financial modeling courses.</p>
                <h4>2. Certainty Factor</h4>
                <p>In the second screenshot below, you can see how this alternative approach is taken in Excel. This
                    time, an analyst uses only the risk-free rate of 2.5% as the discount rate. There is, however, an
                    additional adjustment factor of 70% applied to each cash flow. The way to think about this is,
                    “there is a 70% chance of receiving $10,000 each year”, or, “there is a 100% chance of receiving
                    $7,021 each year.”</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/blog/intrinsic-value-4.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
                <p>As you can see, for this same investment that pays $10,000 at the end of each year for 10 years with
                    a 70% confidence factor and 2.5% discount rate, the intrinsic value is $61,446 (the same as method
                    #1).</p>
                <h3>Challenges with Intrinsic Value</h3>
                <p>The trouble with calculating intrinsic value is it’s a very subjective exercise. There are so many
                    assumptions that must be made, and the final net present value Net Present Value (NPV)</span><span
                        class="meta-description">Net Present
                        Value (NPV) is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the
                        entire life of an investment discounted to the present is very
                        sensitive to changes in those assumptions.</p>
                <p>Each of the assumptions in the WACC ( Beta , Market Risk Premium.) can be calculated in different
                    ways, while the assumption
                    around a confidence/probability factor is entirely subjective.</p>
                <p>Essentially, when it comes to predicting the future, it is by definition, uncertain. For this reason,
                    all of the most successful investors in the world can look at the same information about a company
                    and arrive at totally different figures for its intrinsic value.</p>

                <h3>Other Forms of Valuation</h3>
                <p>Intrinsic valuation is often used for long-term investment strategies, but there are many other
                    approaches to valuation and investing.&nbsp;Alternatives include technical analysis, relative
                    valuation,
                    and cost approach.</p>
                <h4>1. Technical Analysis</h4>
                <p>Technical analysis involves looking at charts and evaluating various indicators that may signal a
                    stock
                    is going to go up or down in the short to medium term. Examples include candlestick charts, momentum
                    and
                    moving averages, relative strength, and more..</p>
                <h4>2. Relative Valuation</h4>
                <p>Relative valuation looks at what other investors are willing to pay for a similar investment and
                    assumes
                    that they would pay a comparable price for the company in question.  The two most common examples of
                    this are comparable company analysis (“Comps”) and precedent transaction analysis (“Precedents”).
                </p>
                <h4>3. Cost Approach</h4>
                <p>In the cost approach, an investor looks at what the cost to build or create something would be and
                    assumes that is what it’s worth. They may look at what it costs others to build a similar business
                    and take into account how costs have changed since then (inflation, deflation, input costs, etc.).
