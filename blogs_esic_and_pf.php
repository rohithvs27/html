                <p>The ESI scheme is applicable to all factories and other establishments as defined in the Act with 10
                    or more persons employed in such establishment and the beneficiaries’ monthly wage does not exceed
                    Rs 21,000 are covered under the scheme. Whether the employer has employed 10 or more employees, all
                    employees employed by the employer, agnostic of the salary are reckoned.</p>
                <p>The applicability of the scheme is explained through a flow chart below:</p>
