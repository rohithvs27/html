                <h4>Section wise Income Tax Deductions for AY 2022-23/ FY 2021-22</h4>
                <p>
                    In this article we have discussed Income Tax deduction available to Taxpayers from various sources
                    of Income for A.Y. 2022-23 / F.Y. 2021-22 and subsequent Years. Deductions include deduction Against
                    Salaries, Against ‘income from house properties‘, Against ‘profits and gains of business or
                    profession‘ Against ‘capital gains‘ and Against ‘income from other sources’. </p>
                <h4>DEDUCTIONS</h4>
                <h5>[AY 2022-23]</h5>
                <p>
                    Indian Companies Act 2013 has fewer sections (470) than Companies Act 1956 (658). The new act
                    empowers shareholders and gives high value for Corporate Governance.
