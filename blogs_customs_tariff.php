                    <p>
                        The designated authority while determining the normal value,
                        export price and margin of dumping shall take into account <i>
                            inter alia</i>, the following principles -
                    </p>
                    <p>1. The elements of costs referred
                        to in the context of determination of normal value shall normally
                        be determined on the basis of records kept by the exporter or
                        producer under investigation, provided such records are in
                        accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of
                        the exporting country, and such records reasonably reflect the
                        cost associated with production and sale of the article under
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>2. Sales of the like product in
                        the domestic market of the exporting country or sales to a third
                        country at prices below per unit (fixed and variable) costs of
                        production plus administrative, selling and general costs may be
                        treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of
                        price. The designated authority may disregard these sales, in
                        determining normal value, provided it has determined that -</p>
                    <p>(i) such sales are made within a
                        reasonable period of time (not less than six months) in
                        substantial quantities, i.e. when the weighted average selling
                        price of the article is below the weighted average per unit costs
                        or when the volume of the sales below per unit costs represents
                        not less than twenty per cent of the volume sold in transactions
                        under consideration, and</p>
                    <p>(ii) such sales are at prices which do
                        not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable
                        period of time. The said prices will be considered to provide for
                        recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time if they are
                        above weighted average per unit costs for the period of
                        investigation, even though they might have been below per unit
                        costs at the time of sale.</p>
                    <p>3. (i) The said authority
                        in the course of investigation shall consider all available
                        evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which
                        is made available by the exporter or producer provided that such
                        allocation has been historically utilized by the exporter or
                        producer, in relation to establishing appropriate amortization
                        and depreciation periods and allowances for capital expenditure
                        and other development costs.</p>
                    <p>(ii) unless already reflected in
                        allocation of costs referred to in clause (1) and sub-clause (i)
                        above, the designated authority, will also make appropriate
                        adjustments for those non-recurring items of cost which benefits
                        further and/or current production, or for circumstances in which
                        costs during the period of investigation are affected by start up
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>4. The amounts for
                        administrative, selling and general costs and for profits as
                        referred to in sub-section (1) of section 9A of the Act, shall be
                        based on actual data pertaining to production and sales in the
                        ordinary course of trade, of the like article by the exporter or
                        producer under investigation. When such amounts cannot be
                        determined on this basis, the amounts may be determined on the
                        basis of :</p>
                    <p>(i) the actual amounts incurred and
                        realised by the exporter or producer in question, in respect of
                        production and sales in the domestic market of the country of
                        origin of the same general category of article;</p>
                    <p>(ii) the weighted average of the actual
                        amounts incurred and realized by other exporters or producers
                        subject to investigation in respect of production and sales of
                        the like article in the domestic market of the country of origin;
                        or</p>
                    <p>(iii) any other reasonable method,
                        provided that the amount for profit so established shall not
                        exceed the profit normally realized by the exporters or producers
                        on sales of products of the same general category in the domestic
                        market of the country of origin.</p>
                    <p>5. The designated authority,
                        while arriving at a constructed export price, shall give due
                        allowance for costs including duties and taxes, incurred between
                        importation and resale and for profits.</p>
                    <p>6. (i) While arriving at
                        margin of dumping, the designated authority shall make a fair
                        comparison between the export price and the normal value. The
                        comparison shall be made at the same level of trade, normally at
                        the ex-factory level, and in respect of sales made at as nearly
                        as possible the same time. Due allowance shall be made in each
                        case, on its merits, for differences which affect price
                        comparability, including differences in conditions and terms of
                        sale, taxation, levels of trade, quantities, physical
                        characteristics, and any other differences which are demonstrated
                        to affect price comparability.</p>
                    <p>(ii) In the cases where export price is
                        a constructed price, the comparison shall be made only after
                        establishing the normal value at equivalent level of trade.</p>
                    <p>(iii) When the comparison under this
                        para requires a conversion of currencies, such conversion should
                        be made by using the rate of exchange on the date of sale,
                        provided that when a sale on foreign currency on forward markets
                        is directly linked to the export sale involved the rate of
                        exchange in the forward sale shall be used. Fluctuations in
                        exchange rates shall be ignored and in an investigation the
                        exporters shall be given at least sixty days to have adjusted
                        their export prices to reflect sustained movements in exchange
                        rates during the period of investigation.</p>
                    <p>(iv) Subject to the provisions governing comparison
                        in this paragraph, the existence of margin of dumping during the
                        investigation phase shall normally be established on the basis of
                        a comparison of a weighted average normal value and export prices
                        on a transaction-to-transaction basis. A normal value established
                        on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of
                        individual export transactions if it is found that a pattern of
                        export prices which differ significantly among different
                        purchasers, regions or time periods, and if an explanation is
                        provided as to why such differences cannot be taken into account
                        appropriately by the use of a weighted average-to-weighted
                        average or transaction-to-transaction comparison.</p>
                    <p>[7. In case of imports from non-market
                        economy countries, normal value shall be determined on the basis
                        of the price or constructed value in a market economy third
                        country, or the price from such a third country to other
                        countries, including India, or where it is not possible, on any
                        other reasonable basis, including the price actually paid or
                        payable in India for the like product, duly adjusted if
                        necessary, to include a reasonable profit margin. An appropriate
                        market economy third country shall be selected by the designated
                        authority in a reasonable manner [keeping in view the level of
                        development of the country concerned and the product in question]
                        and due account shall be taken of any reliable information made
                        available at the time of the selection. Account shall also be
                        taken within time limits; where appropriate, of the investigation
                        if any made in similar matter in respect of any other market
                        economy third country. The parties to the investigation shall be
                        informed without unreasonable delay the aforesaid selection of
                        the market economy third country and shall be given a reasonable
                        period of time to offer their comments.]</p>
                    <p>[8. (1) The term "non-market economy
                        country" means any country which the designated authority
                        determines as not operating on market principles of cost or
                        pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in
                        such country do not reflect the fair value of
                        the merchandise, in accordance with the
                        criteria specified in sub-paragraph (3).</p>
                    <p>(2) There shall be a presumption

                        treated as, a non-market economy country for purposes of an

                        of material injury to domestic industry or material retardation
                        of the establishment of such an industry, hereinafter referred to
                        as "injury" and casual link between dumped imports and such
                        injury, shall <i>inter alia</i>, take following principles under
                        consideration -
                    </p>
                    <p>(i) A determination of injury
                        shall involve an objective examination of both (a) the volume of
                        the dumped imports and the affect of the dumped imports on prices
                        in the domestic market for like article and (b) the consequent
                        impact of these imports on domestic producers of such products.</p>
                    <p>(ii) While examining the volume
                        of dumped imports, the said authority shall consider whether
                        there has been a significant increase in the dumped imports,
                        either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption
                        in India. With regard to the affect of the dumped imports on
                        prices as referred to in sub-rule (2) of rule 18 the designated
                        authority shall consider whether there has been a significant
                        price under cutting by the dumped imports as compared with the
                        price of like product in India, or whether the effect of such
                        imports is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or
                        prevent price increase which otherwise would have occurred, to a
                        significant degree.</p>
                    <p>(iii) In cases where imports of a
                        product from more than one country are being simultaneously
                        subjected to anti-dumping investigation, the designated authority
                        will cumulatively assess the effect of such imports, only when it
                        determines that (a) the margin of dumping established in relation
                        to the imports from each country is more than two per cent
                        expressed as percentage of export price and the volume of the
                        imports from each country is three per cent of the import of like
                        article or where the export of individual countries less than
                        three per cent, the imports collectively accounts for more than
                        seven per cent of the import of like article and (b) cumulative
                        assessment of the effect of imports is appropriate in light of
                        the conditions of competition between the imported article and
                        the like domestic articles.</p>
                    <p>(iv) The examination of the
                        impact of the dumped imports on the domestic industry concerned,
                        shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and
                        indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including
                        natural and [potential] decline in sales, profits, output, market
                        share, productivity, return on investments or utilisation of
                        capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; the magnitude of the
                        margin of dumping; actual and potential negative effects on cash
                        flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise
                        capital investments.</p>
                    <p>
                        (v) It must be demonstrated that the dumped imports are,
                        through the effects of dumping, as set forth in paragraphs (ii)
                        and (iv) above, causing injury to the domestic industry. The
                        demonstration of a casual relationship between the dumped
                        imports and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on
                        an examination of relevant evidence before the designated
                        authority. The designated authority shall also examine any known
                        factors other than the dumped imports which at the same time are
                        injuring the domestic industry, and the injury caused by these
                        other factors must not be attributed to the dumped imports.
                        Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, <i>inter
                            alia</i>, the volume and prices of imports not sold at dumping
                        prices, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of
                        consumption, trade restrictive practices of and competition
                        between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in
                        technology and the export performance and the productivity of the
                        domestic industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>(vi) The effect of the dumped
                        imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production
                        of the like article when available data permit the separate
                        identification of that production on the basis of such criteria
                        as the production process, producers' sales and profits. If such
                        separate identification of that production is not possible, the
                        effects of the dumped imports shall be assessed by the
                        examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of
                        products, which includes the like product, for which the
                        necessary information can be provided.</p>
                    <p>
                        (vii) A determination of a threat of material injury shall
                        be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or
                        remote possibility. The change in circumstances which would
                        create a situation in which the dumping would cause injury must
                        be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination
                        regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, the
                        designated authority shall consider, <i>inter alia</i>, such
                        factors as :
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (a) a significant rate
                        of increase of dumped imports into India indicating the
                        likelihood of substantially increased importation;</p>
                    <p>
                        (b) sufficient freely
                        disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of
                        the exporter indicating the likelihood of substantially increased
                        dumped exports to Indian markets, taking into account the
                        availability of other export markets to absorb any additional
                        exports;</p>
                    <p>
                        (c) whether imports are
                        entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or
                        suppressing effect on domestic prices, and would likely increase
                        demand for further imports; and</p>
                    <p>(d)
                        inventories of the article being investigated.</p>
