                    <h2>What is Book Value?</h2>
                    <p>Book value is a company’s equity value as reported in its financial statements
                        Three Financial Statements
                        The three financial statements are the income statement,
                        the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. These three core statements
                        are. The book value figure is typically viewed in relation to
                        the company’s stock value Market Capitalization Market Capitalization (Market Cap) is the most
                        recent&nbsp;market value of a company’s outstanding shares. Market Cap is equal to
                        the current share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. The
                        investing community often uses the market capitalization value to rank
                        companies and is determined by taking the total value of a
                        company’s assets and subtracting any of the liabilities the company still owes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Below is the Book Value Formula:</strong></p>

                    <p>The company’s Balance Sheet The balance sheet
                        is one of the three fundamental financial statements. The financial statements are
                        key to both financial modeling and accounting. also incorporates depreciation in the book value
                        of assets. It
                        attempts to match the book value with&nbsp; the real or actual value of the company. Book
                        value is typically shown per share, determined by dividing all shareholder equity Stockholders
                        Equity Stockholders Equity (also known as Shareholders Equity) is
                        an account on a company's balance sheet that consists of share capital
                        plus by the number of common
                        stock shares that are outstanding.</p>
                    <h3>Importance of Book Value</h3>
                    <p>Book value is considered important in terms of valuation because
                        it represents a fair and accurate picture of a company’s worth. The figure is determined
                        using historical company data and isn’t typically a subjective figure. It means that
                        investors and market analysts get a reasonable idea of the company’s worth.</span></p>
                    <p>Book value is primarily important for investors using a value investing
                        strategy Stock Investing: A
                        Guide to Value Investing Since the publication
                        of "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham, what is commonly known as "value
                        investing" has become one of the most widely respected and widely followed methods
                        of stock picking. because it can enable them to find bargain
                        deals on stocks, especially if they suspect that a company is undervalued and/or is poised to
                        grow, and the stock is going to rise in price.</p>
                    <p>Stocks that trade below book value are often considered a steal because they are anticipated to
                        turn around and trade higher. Investors who can grab the stocks while costs are low in relation
                        to the company’s book value are in an ideal position to make a substantial profit and be in a
                        good trading position down the road.</p>
                    <h3>The Issue of Intangibles</h3>
                    <p>Book value’s inescapable flaw is the fact that it doesn’t accurately account for intangible
                        assets of value within a company, which includes items such as patents and intellectual
                        property. What does
                        this mean for investors? It means they need to be wise and observant, taking the type of company
                        and the industry it operates in under consideration.</p>
                    <p>For example, consider a value investor who is looking at the stock of a company that designs and
                        sells apps. Because it is a technology company, a major portion of the company’s value is rooted
                        in the ideas for, and rights to create, the apps it markets.</p>
                    <p>The company could be trading much higher than its book value because the market’s valuation takes
                        into account the company’s intangible assets, Intangible Assets According to the IFRS,
                        intangible assets are identifiable,
                        non-monetary assets without physical substance. Like all assets, intangible
                        assets such as intellectual property. The stock, then, isn’t
                        really overpriced – its book value is lower simply because it doesn’t accurately account for all
                        the aspects of value that the company holds.</p>
                    <h3>Final Word</h3>
                    <p>Book value is a widely-used financial metric to determine a company’s value and
                        to ascertain whether its stock price is over- or
                        under-appreciated. It’s wise for investors and traders to pay close attention, however, to the
                        nature of the company and other assets that may not be well represented in the book value.</p>
