                <p>With the advent of MNCs(Multi National Concerns) a trend has also been adopted by the MNCs to
                    structure their investments and business strategy in such a way that profits are maximized in such
                    jurisdictions where tax rates are low, which give rise to the emerging&nbsp; problem of
                    <strong>transfer pricing</strong> all over the
                    world. Many countries have made laws to deal with the issue of transfer
                    pricing. India has been a late entrant in making provisions under the Income Tax Act to tackle the
                    issue of transfer pricing. Although there existed section 92 under Income tax Act 1961 but there
                    were not relevant rules which could help tackle the issue of transfer pricing. Section 92A to 92F
                    had been inserted to deal with transfer pricing by the Finance Act, 2001. Some views are expressed
                    in this article as below explaining provisions under the Income Tax Act 1961 dealing with transfer
                    pricing.</p>
                <p><strong>What is Transfer Pricing: </strong>Usually there is a tendency among MNCs to adjust their
                    international transactions in such a way that maximum profit arises in that country where the rate
                    of tax is lowest and minimum profit arises in that country where the rate of tax is highest. This
                    creates the problem of transfer pricing. Thus there may be chances that MNC&nbsp;escape tax in those
                    countries where the tax rate is more by adjusting their international transaction and declaring
                    lesser profits in such country. This can be explained with an example:</p>
                <p>Suppose a subsidiary company, resident in country A (which has a tax rate of, say, 30%) manufactures
                    goods and transfers them to its parent company in country B (which has a tax rate of 20%) for
                    trading. In order to increase the overall profits of the group company, it will seek to supply the
                    goods at prices which are lower than the market price. So, in effect, the subsidiary company in
                    country A will have lower profits and hence, a lower tax incidence whereas the parent company in
                    country B is affected in the opposite manner higher profits due to low costs, but lower taxes
                    because of the tax rate.</p>
                <p>Transfer pricing deals with the technique where parent companies sell goods and services to
                    subsidiary entities at an inflated price to deliberately reduce profits and tax liability. The law
                    requires that goods and services should be sold to subsidiary companies at arm’s length price — the
                    price at which goods are traded between unconnected companies.</p>
                <p>In order to cover such tendencies of MNCs section 92A to 92F have been enacted&nbsp;and section
                    271AA, 271BA and 271G have been incorporated and section 271 has been amended providing for penal
                    provisions in this regard.</p>
                <p><strong>How the income from international transactions will be computed:</strong> As per section 92
                    any income from international transaction shall be computed as per arm’s length price. Any allowance
                    of interest or expenses with respect to the above income shall also be computed having regarded to
                    arm’s length price.

                    <p>Further where, in an international transaction, two or more associated enterprises enter into a
                        mutual agreement for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or
                        expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or
                        to be provided or apportioned to or as the case may be, contributed by, any such enterprises
                        shall be determined having regard to the arm’s length price of such benefit, service or
                        facility, as the case may be.</p>
                    <p>In simple words it means that not only the income from an international transaction is to be
                        computed as per arm’s length price but also any expense or cost to be incurred in an
                        international transaction in connection with a benefit or service or facility to be provided
                        will be computed as per arm’s length price.</p>
                    <p>Section 92 also provides that its provisions shall not apply where it has effect of reducing the
                        income chargeable to tax or increasing the loss, as the case may be, computed on the basis of
                        entries made in the books of account in respect of the previous year in which the international
                        transaction was entered into.</p>
                    <p><strong>Now the question arises about the meaning of some of the concepts as mentioned above like
                            International transactions, associated enterprises and arm’s length. These can be discussed
                            as follows</strong>:</p>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is an International
                                Transaction:</span></strong> To apply the provisions related to transfer pricing as
                        contained u/s 92, 92A to 92F there must be an international transaction.</p>
                    <p>As per section 92B an international transaction means a transaction between two or more
                        associated enterprises, either or both of whom are non-resident and such transaction is in the
                        nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property or provision of services,
                        or lending or borrowing money or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income,
                        losses or assets of such associated enterprises.</p>

                    <p>International transaction shall also include a mutual agreement or arrangement between two or
                        more associated enterprises for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any
                        cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility
                        provided or to be provided to any of such associated enterprises.</p>
                    <p>Further section 92B provides that, where a transaction entered into by an enterprise with a
                        person other than an associated enterprises and there exist a prior agreement in relation to the
                        relevant transaction between such other person and associated enterprise, or the terms of the
                        relevant transaction are determined in substance between such other person and the associated
                        enterprises then such transaction shall also be treated as an international transaction.</p>
                    <p>(a)&nbsp; which participates, directly or indirectly, or though one or more
                        intermediaries, in the management or control or capital of other enterprise; or</p>
                    <p>(b) in respect of which, one or more persons who participate directly or indirectly
                        or through one or more intermediaries, in its management or control or capital, are the same
                        persons who participate, directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, in the
                        management or control or capital of the other enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises if, at any time during the previous

                        or jointly by such member and his relative; or</p>
                    <p>(l) where one enterprise is a firm, association of persons or body

                        may be prescribed.</p>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is arm’s length price:</span></strong> As
                        stated above the income from an international transaction is computed as per arm’s length price.
                        Arm’s length price has been defined in section 92F(ii) as a price which is applied or proposed
                        to be applied in a transaction between persons other than associated enterprises, in
                        uncontrolled conditions.</p>
                    <p>The arm’s length principle suggests that the associated enterprises should be treated as
                        independent enterprises and international transaction is considered at the market price.</p>
                    <p>As per section 92C the arm’s length price in relation to an international transaction shall be
                        determined by any of the prescribed methods discussed as below:</p>
                    <p><strong>Comparable Uncontrolled Prices method (CUP):</strong> Under this method, price charged in
                        an uncontrolled transaction between comparable entities is identified and compared with the
                        tested entity price (after making due adjustments in relation to terms and conditions and risk
                        involved) to determine the ALP.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cost Plus Method (CPM):</strong> Here, the total cost of production incurred by the
                        enterprise in question in transferring goods and services to Associated Enterprises (AEs) is
                        calculated and the total gross profit mark up used by comparable entities in similar
                        transactions with independent enterprises is determined. The total gross mark-up arrived at is
                        adjusted to take into account functional and other differences and is added to the costs
                        calculated to determine ALP.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resale Price Method (RPM):</strong> Under this method the price at which property or
                        services in question are resold or provided to an unrelated enterprise is identified. Such
                        resale price is reduced by the normal gross profit accruing to an enterprise in a comparable
                        incontrolled transaction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Profit Split Method (PSM):</strong> PSM is used when AEs transactions are so integrated
                        that it becomes impossible to conduct a TP analysis on a transactional basis. First, the
                        combined net profit incurring to related enterprises from a transaction is determined. Then, the
                        combined net profit is allocated between related enterprises with reference to market returns
                        achieved by independent entities in similar transactions. The relative contribution of related
                        parties is then evaluated on the basis of assets employed, functions performed or to be
                        performed and risk assumed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM):</strong> TNMM is normally adopted in cases of
                        transfer of semi-finished goods, distribution of finished products (where resale price method
                        (RPM) cannot be adequately applied) and transactions involving the provision of services. TNMM
                        compares the net profit margin relative to an appropriate base (sales, assets or costs incurred)
                        of the tested party with net profit margin of the independent enterprises in similar
                        transactions after making adjustments.</p>
                    <p><strong>Any other method as may be prescribed by the Board</strong></p>
                    <p>The most appropriate method of all the above methods should be applied in determining arm’s
                        length price depending upon various factors like nature of transaction availability of
                        information etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method, </strong>the
                        arm’s length price shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices.</p>
                    <p>Actual price at which international transaction has been undertaken shall be accepted where the
                        variation with the arm’s length price doesn’t exceed 5 percent.</p>
                    <p>Section 92CB provides that w.e.f. asst. year 2009-10 Income tax authorities will accept the
                        transfer price declared by the assessee provided they are in accordance with the Safe Harbor
                        Rules to be notified by CBDT. Safe Harbour means circumstances in which the income tax
                        authorities shall accept the transfer price declared by the assessee.</p>
                    <p>When the assessing officer can determine arm’s length price: As per section 92C(3)</p>
                    <p>Where during the course of any proceeding for the assessment of income, the Assessing Officer is,
                        on the basis of material or information or document in his possession, of the opinion that—</p>
                    <p>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp; the price charged or paid in an international transaction has not been
                        determined in accordance with the prescribed manner; or</p>
                    <p>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp; any information and document relating to an international transaction have not
                        been kept and maintained by the assessee in accordance with the provisions contained in
                        sub-section (1) of section 92D and the rules made in this behalf; or</p>
                    <p>(<em>c</em>)&nbsp; the information or data used in computation of the arm’s length price is not
                        reliable or correct; or</p>
                    <p>(<em>d</em>)&nbsp; the assessee has failed to furnish, within the specified time, any information
                        or document which he was required to furnish by a notice issued under sub-section (3) of section
                        92D,</p>
                    <p>the Assessing Officer may proceed to determine the arm’s length price in relation to the said
                        international transaction on the basis of the information or material available.</p>
                    <p><strong>Procedure to be followed by the assessing officer while determining arm’s length
                            price:</strong> Proviso to section 92C(3) provides that an opportunity shall be given by the
                        Assessing Officer by serving a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a date and
                        time to be specified in the notice, why the arm’s length price should not be so determined on
                        the basis of material or information or document in the possession of the Assessing Officer.</p>
                    <p>The Finance Act 2002 has inserted a new section 92CA according to which in case of international
                        transaction, the A.O may refer the matter to Transfer Pricing officer, if he considers it
                        necessary or expedient to do so, with the prior approval of commissioner, for the purpose of

                    <p>With the advent of MNCs(Multi National Concerns) a trend has also been adopted by the MNCs to
                        structure their investments and business strategy in such a way that profits are maximized in
                        such jurisdictions where tax rates are low, which give rise to the emerging&nbsp; problem of
                        <strong>transfer pricing</strong> all over the
                        world. Many countries have made laws to deal with the issue of
                        transfer pricing. India has been a late entrant in making provisions under the Income Tax Act to
                        tackle the issue of transfer pricing. Although there existed section 92 under Income tax Act
                        1961 but there were not relevant rules which could help tackle the issue of transfer pricing.
                        Section 92A to 92F had been inserted to deal with transfer pricing by the Finance Act, 2001.
                        Some views are expressed in this article as below explaining provisions under the Income Tax Act
                        1961 dealing with transfer pricing.</p>
                    <h4>What is Transfer Pricing: </h4>
                    <p>Usually there is a tendency among MNCs to adjust their
                        international transactions in such a way that maximum profit arises in that country where the
                        rate of tax is lowest and minimum profit arises in that country where the rate of tax is
                        highest. This creates the problem of transfer pricing. Thus there may be chances that
                        MNC&nbsp;escape tax in those countries where the tax rate is more by adjusting their
                        international transaction and declaring lesser profits in such country. This can be explained
                        with an example:</p>
                    <p>Suppose a subsidiary company, resident in country A (which has a tax rate of, say, 30%)
                        manufactures goods and transfers them to its parent company in country B (which has a tax rate
                        of 20%) for trading. In order to increase the overall profits of the group company, it will seek
                        to supply the goods at prices which are lower than the market price. So, in effect, the
                        subsidiary company in country A will have lower profits and hence, a lower tax incidence whereas
                        the parent company in country B is affected in the opposite manner higher profits due to low
                        costs, but lower taxes because of the tax rate.</p>
                    <p>Transfer pricing deals with the technique where parent companies sell goods and services to
                        subsidiary entities at an inflated price to deliberately reduce profits and tax liability. The
                        law requires that goods and services should be sold to subsidiary companies at arm’s length
                        price — the price at which goods are traded between unconnected companies.</p>
                    <p>In order to cover such tendencies of MNCs section 92A to 92F have been enacted&nbsp;and section
                        271AA, 271BA and 271G have been incorporated and section 271 has been amended providing for
                        penal provisions in this regard.</p>
                    <p><strong>How the income from international transactions will be computed:</strong> As per section
                        92 any income from international transaction shall be computed as per arm’s length price. Any
                        allowance of interest or expenses with respect to the above income shall also be computed having
                        regarded to arm’s length price.

                        <p>Further where, in an international transaction, two or more associated enterprises
                            enter into a mutual agreement for the allocation or apportionment of, or any
                            contribution to, any cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a
                            benefit, service or facility provided or to be provided or apportioned to or as the
                            case may be, contributed by, any such enterprises shall be determined having regard
                            to the arm’s length price of such benefit, service or facility, as the case may be.
                        </p>
                        <p>In simple words it means that not only the income from an international transaction
                            is to be computed as per arm’s length price but also any expense or cost to be
                            incurred in an international transaction in connection with a benefit or service or
                            facility to be provided will be computed as per arm’s length price.</p>
                        <p>Section 92 also provides that its provisions shall not apply where it has effect of
                            reducing the income chargeable to tax or increasing the loss, as the case may be,
                            computed on the basis of entries made in the books of account in respect of the
                            previous year in which the international transaction was entered into.</p>
                        <p><strong>Now the question arises about the meaning of some of the concepts as
                                mentioned above like International transactions, associated enterprises and
                                arm’s length. These can be discussed as follows</strong>:</p>

                        <p>As per section 92B an international transaction means a transaction between two or

                        <p>International transaction shall also include a mutual agreement or
                            arrangement between two or more associated enterprises for the allocation or

                            be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or to
                            be provided to any of such associated enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Further section 92B provides that, where a transaction entered into by an

                            considered at the market price.</p>
                        <p>As per section 92C the arm’s length price in relation to an international
                            transaction shall be determined by any of the prescribed methods discussed
                            as below:</p>
                        <p><strong>Comparable Uncontrolled Prices method (CUP):</strong> Under this
                            method, price charged in an uncontrolled transaction between comparable
                            entities is identified and compared with the tested entity price (after
                            making due adjustments in relation to terms and conditions and risk
                            involved) to determine the ALP.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cost Plus Method (CPM):</strong> Here, the total cost of production
                            incurred by the enterprise in question in transferring goods and services to
                            Associated Enterprises (AEs) is calculated and the total gross profit mark
                            up used by comparable entities in similar transactions with independent
                            enterprises is determined. The total gross mark-up arrived at is adjusted to
                            take into account functional and other differences and is added to the costs
                            calculated to determine ALP.</p>
                        <p><strong>Resale Price Method (RPM):</strong> Under this method the price at
                            which property or services in question are resold or provided to an
                            unrelated enterprise is identified. Such resale price is reduced by the
                            normal gross profit accruing to an enterprise in a comparable incontrolled
                            transaction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Profit Split Method (PSM):</strong> PSM is used when AEs transactions
                            are so integrated that it becomes impossible to conduct a TP analysis on a
                            transactional basis. First, the combined net profit incurring to related
                            enterprises from a transaction is determined. Then, the combined net profit
                            is allocated between related enterprises with reference to market returns
                            achieved by independent entities in similar transactions. The relative
                            contribution of related parties is then evaluated on the basis of assets
                            employed, functions performed or to be performed and risk assumed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM):</strong> TNMM is normally
                            adopted in cases of transfer of semi-finished goods, distribution of
                            finished products (where resale price method (RPM) cannot be adequately
                            applied) and transactions involving the provision of services. TNMM compares
                            the net profit margin relative to an appropriate base (sales, assets or
                            costs incurred) of the tested party with net profit margin of the
                            independent enterprises in similar transactions after making adjustments.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Any other method as may be prescribed by the Board</strong></p>
                        <p>The most appropriate method of all the above methods should be applied in
                            determining arm’s length price depending upon various factors like nature of
                            transaction availability of information etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate
                                method, </strong>the arm’s length price shall be taken to be the
                            arithmetical mean of such prices.</p>
                        <p>Actual price at which international transaction has been undertaken shall be
                            accepted where the variation with the arm’s length price doesn’t exceed 5
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>Section 92CB provides that w.e.f. asst. year 2009-10 Income tax authorities
                            will accept the transfer price declared by the assessee provided they are in
                            accordance with the Safe Harbor Rules to be notified by CBDT. Safe Harbour
                            means circumstances in which the income tax authorities shall accept the
                            transfer price declared by the assessee.</p>
                        <p>When the assessing officer can determine arm’s length price: As per section
                            92C(3)</p>

                        <p>the Assessing Officer may proceed to determine the arm’s length price in
                            relation to the said international transaction on the basis of the
                            information or material available.</p>
                        <p><strong>Procedure to be followed by the assessing officer while determining
                                arm’s length price:</strong> Proviso to section 92C(3) provides that an
                            opportunity shall be given by the Assessing Officer by serving a notice
                            calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a date and time to be specified
                            in the notice, why the arm’s length price should not be so determined on the
                            basis of material or information or document in the possession of the
                            Assessing Officer.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Act 2002 has inserted a new section 92CA according to which in
                            case of international transaction, the A.O may refer the matter to Transfer
                            Pricing officer, if he considers it necessary or expedient to do so, with
                            the prior approval of commissioner, for the purpose of computing arm’s
                            length price.</p>
                        <p>The following procedure will be followed by TPO while determining ALP:</p>
                        <p>(1) Where a reference is made to the TPO, the Transfer Pricing Officer shall
                            serve a notice on the assessee requiring him to produce or cause to be
                            produced on a date to be specified therein, any evidence on which the
                            assessee may rely in support of the computation made by him of the arm’s

                        <p>(2) On the date specified in the notice , or as soon thereafter as may be,
                            after hearing such evidence as the assessee may produce, including any
                            information or documents referred to in sub-section (3) of section 92D and
                            after considering such evidence as the Transfer Pricing Officer may require
                            on any specified points and after taking into account all relevant materials
                            which he has gathered, the Transfer Pricing Officer shall, by order in
                            writing, determine the arm’s length price in relation to the international
                            transaction and send a copy of his order to the Assessing Officer and to the
                            assessee.</p>
                        <p>(3) On receipt of the order under from TPO, the Assessing Officer shall
                            proceed to compute the total income of the assessee &nbsp;in conformity with
                            the arm’s length price as so determined by the

                        </p>
                        <p>(1) The income from the international transaction should be
                            computed as per arm’s length price</p>
                        <p>(2) Every person who has entered into an international
