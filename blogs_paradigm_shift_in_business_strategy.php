                        <p>Companies that seemed to be doing well before the pandemic
                            are gasping for air while those lucky enough to have made their digital
                                transformation before Covid-19 have been prospering. In 2021, things could be
                            completely different -- especially if the world can get Covid-19
                            under control.</p>
                   
                        <p>The current pandemic is the most dramatic and powerful shift&nbsp;in the business
                            environment. Others -- such as rapidly emerging technological innovations, the growing power
                            of social media to influence customer behavior, and the rapid flow of private capital into
                            aggressive upstarts -- all require business leaders to adapt very quickly.</p>
                   
                        <p>The traditional approach to business strategy -- the choices a leader makes about where and
                            how to compete in order to achieve a company's goals --&nbsp;is not well suited to this
                            accelerated pace of change.</p>
                   
                        <p>How so? Here are three key elements of traditional strategic planning that are simply too
                            ponderous and bureaucratic to generate valuable, actionable insights quickly enough to get
                            results:</p>
                    
                                     
                        <ul>
                            <li>Business strategy is developed though interdisciplinary business unit teams working with
                                outside consultants that spend months gathering research and assembling formal
                                presentations.</li>
                            <li>Steering committees of corporate executives review interim presentations, provide
                                feedback, and send the business unit teams back to rework their presentations.</li>
                            <li>Excessive quantification of unknown future outcomes often leads to strategic discussions
                                that center on debating financial assumptions, which delays strategic decisions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    
                        <p>To help your business adapt more effectively as the pace of change accelerates,&nbsp;here are
                            five ways business strategy will be different in 2025.</p>
                   
                        <h4>1. Envision the most powerful external forces that could upend your business.</h4>
                   
                        <p>Forces outside of your company's control are changing rapidly. Some could benefit
                            your business, some could slash its revenue. Some could be irrelevant.                            
                        </p>
                                   
                    
                        <p>Leaders should operate a&nbsp;systematic approach to forecasting which of these evolving
                            forces demand a change in strategy. Simply put, this process will help you reposition your
                            company so that powerful external forces become tailwinds, rather than headwinds. By 2025,
                            business strategy will start with such a process.</p>
                   
                        <p>But what would it look like? As I described in <em>Hungry Start-Up Strategy</em>, the way to
                            do this is through a process I called "boundaryless company development." Here, leaders set
                            up listening posts throughout their value networks -- the chains of companies between raw
                            materials and consumers. Leaders pick up weak signals, separate the signals from the noise,
                            and consider options for how best to respond to the strongest signals.</p>
                   
                        <h4>2. Understand how current and potential customers' priorities are changing.</h4>
                   
                        <p>Current and potential customers are generally the most important places to listen for
                            meaningful signals of change. Business strategists should engage these customers in a
                            dialogue regarding their most significant concerns as they look to the future and how
                            external changes could rejigger customer priorities.</p>
                   
                        <p>These changing customer priorities could set up a scramble for how your company should
                            respond. Do you need to develop new products to meet those new customer needs? Can you get
                            products to market quickly that will satisfy customer needs more effectively&nbsp;than your
                            competitors?&nbsp;</p>
                   
                        <p>By 2025, business strategy will be well-equipped to enable your company to answer such
                            questions.</p>
                   
                        <h4>3. Generate deep insights into incumbent and fast-growing upstart CEOs' strategic mindsets.
                        </h4>
                   
                        <p>Your company will most likely face competition in seizing these growth opportunities. You
                            will need to size up your competition quickly and accurately.</p>
                   
                        <p>My soon-to-be-published book, <em>Goliath Strikes Back</em>, describes three strategic
                            mindsets or ways that CEOs identify and solve problems. Two such mindsets -- "create the
                            future" and "fast follower" --&nbsp;are likely to challenge your ability to capture the
                            growth.&nbsp;The customers of the other one --<em>&nbsp;</em>"head in the sand" -- could be
                            yours for the taking.</p>
                   
                        <p>By 2025, business strategists will be experienced at analyzing which competitors have which
                            strategic mindsets -- and will be able to position themselves appropriately.</p>
                   
                        <h4>4. Reimagine your business strategy to turn headwinds into tailwinds while winning on
                            emerging customer priorities.</h4>
                   
                        <p>Having gained useful insights about emerging external forces, evolving customer needs, and
                            the strategic mindset of competitors, business leaders will need to make key choices to
                            reposition their company to capture the opportunities and defend against the threats.</p>
                   
                        <p>These strategic choices -- such as which customer groups to serve, which customer needs to
                            serve, what products to offer, and how to perform key activities such as product
                            development, manufacturing, and sales -- will be made using traditional tools of business
                            strategy.</p>
                   
                        <h4>5. Empower your people to set performance metrics tied to the reimagined strategy and hold
                            them accountable.</h4>
                   
                        <p>What will be different in 2025&nbsp;is that CEOs will treat their people like
                            entrepreneurs,&nbsp;giving them the power to gather these insights, make strategic choices,
                            and set their own key performance indicators. By 2025, CEOs will provide the resources
                            people need and hold them accountable for achieving the&nbsp;goals.</p>
                   
                   
                        <p>These five&nbsp;changes will&nbsp;accelerate the competition for market share. Don't get left
                            behind.</p>
