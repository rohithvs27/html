              It is essential to determine residential status of taxpayer to determine taxability of

              in India, irrespective of the fact that income is earned or has accrued to taxpayer outside
              India. However, in case of non-resident all income which accrues or arises outside India
              would not be taxable in India.

            <h3>Loan</h3>
            <p>
            The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in
                    exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, the lender also adds
                    interest and/or finance charges to the principal value which the borrower must repay in addition to
                    the principal balance. Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an
                    open-ended line of credit up to a specified limit.

            <h3>Introduction to the Project Finance</h3>
            <p>
            When a company decides to fund an idea of establishing or extending an industrial project such as
                    manufacturing units, construction, or other infrastructures, <strong>Project Finance</strong> is the
                    top pursued solution. Due to the capital-intensive nature of such projects, most companies in their
                    nascent stage, find it nearly impossible to fund the project entirely on their own.
