                <h4>Introd​uction</h4>
                <p>
                It is essential to determine residential status of taxpayer to determine taxability of income earned by such taxpayer. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In case of resident taxpayer all his income would be taxable in India, irrespective of the fact that income is earned or has accrued to taxpayer outside India. However, in case of non-resident all income which accrues or arises outside India would not be taxable in India. 
            </p>
            <h4>Meaning of Non-resident</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Section 2(30) defines non-resident as a person who is not a resident.</li>
            <li>Section 6​ lays down the test of residency for different taxpayers</li>
            </ul>
