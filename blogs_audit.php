                <p>Audits enable senior management to evaluate projects and programmes against pre-agreed criteria. They
                    indicate the level of compliance with procedures and processes and identify areas for improvement or
                    where lessons need to be learned.</p>

                <h4>An oveview of audits</h4>
                <p>Audits benefit the programme or project by providing a health check and recommending actions. Senior
                    management gain an insight into the problems in the business, the level of risk they are facing and
                    the actions that need to be taken. The companies’ clients can gain confidence in the quality of the
                    outputs and visibility of any areas that need to be addressed. The responsibility for authorising an
                    audit rests with senior management who should ensure that the audit team have a clear brief of the
                    objectives, scope, timings, restrictions and format. The scope may look at the management, status,
                    quality and/or interfaces of a programme or project. In developing the scope the sponsors may
                    consider size, complexity, results of previous audits, frequency of audits, stakeholder interests
                    and the level of change within the organization.</p>
                <p>Typical audits will either look at operational, structural or product compliance. Operational
                    compliance is concerned with process and methodologies and structural with standards and codes of
                    practice. Product compliance assesses products against specifications and may also check against
                    formal standards like ISO</p>
                <p>Audits may be carried out internally, by the organization’s client perhaps as part of a tender
                    evaluation process, or by an independent organization such as a government, regulatory or
                    accreditation body.

                <p>The company’s Balance Sheet The balance sheet
                    is one of the three fundamental financial statements. The financial statements are
                    key to both financial modeling and accounting. also incorporates depreciation in the book value
                    of assets. It
                    attempts to match the book value with&nbsp; the real or actual value of the company. Book
                    value is typically shown per share, determined by dividing all shareholder equity Stockholders
                    Equity Stockholders Equity (also known as Shareholders Equity) is
                    an account on a company's balance sheet that consists of share capital
                    plus by the number of common
                    stock shares that are outstanding.</p>
                <h3>Importance of Book Value</h3>
                <p>Book value is considered important in terms of valuation because
                    it represents a fair and accurate picture of a company’s worth. The figure is determined
                    using historical company data and isn’t typically a subjective figure. It means that
                    investors and market analysts get a reasonable idea of the company’s worth.</span></p>
                <p>Book value is primarily important for investors using a value investing
                    strategy Stock Investing: A
                    Guide to Value Investing Since the publication
                    of "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham, what is commonly known as "value
                    investing" has become one of the most widely respected and widely followed methods
                    of stock picking. because it can enable them to find bargain
                    deals on stocks, especially if they suspect that a company is undervalued and/or is poised to
                    grow, and the stock is going to rise in price.</p>
                <p>Stocks that trade below book value are often considered a steal because they are anticipated to
                    turn around and trade higher. Investors who can grab the stocks while costs are low in relation
                    to the company’s book value are in an ideal position to make a substantial profit and be in a
                    good trading position down the road.</p>
                <h3>The Issue of Intangibles</h3>
                <p>Book value’s inescapable flaw is the fact that it doesn’t accurately account for intangible
                    assets of value within a company, which includes items such as patents and intellectual
                    property. What does
                    this mean for investors? It means they need to be wise and observant, taking the type of company
                    and the industry it operates in under consideration.</p>
                <p>For example, consider a value investor who is looking at the stock of a company that designs and
                    sells apps. Because it is a technology company, a major portion of the company’s value is rooted
                    in the ideas for, and rights to create, the apps it markets.</p>
                <p>The company could be trading much higher than its book value because the market’s valuation takes
                    into account the company’s intangible assets, Intangible Assets According to the IFRS,
                    intangible assets are identifiable,
                    non-monetary assets without physical substance. Like all assets, intangible
                    assets such as intellectual property. The stock, then, isn’t
                    really overpriced – its book value is lower simply because it doesn’t accurately account for all
                    the aspects of value that the company holds.</p>
                <h3>Final Word</h3>
                <p>Book value is a widely-used financial metric to determine a company’s value and
                    to ascertain whether its stock price is over- or
                    under-appreciated. It’s wise for investors and traders to pay close attention, however, to the
                    nature of the company and other assets that may not be well represented in the book value.</p>
