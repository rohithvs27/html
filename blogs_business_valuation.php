                <h4> What Is a Business Valuation? </h4>
                <p>
                    A business valuation is a general process of determining the economic value of a whole business or
                    company unit. Business valuation can be used to determine the fair value of a business for a variety
                    of reasons, including sale value, establishing partner ownership, taxation,&nbsp;and even divorce
                    proceedings. Owners will often turn to professional business evaluators for an objective estimate of
                    the value of the business.

                <h4>The Basics of Business Valuation </h4>
                <p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
                    The topic of business valuation is frequently discussed in corporate finance. Business valuation is
                    typically
                    conducted when a company is looking to sell all or a portion of its operations or looking to merge
                    with or
                    acquire another company. The valuation of a business is the process of determining the current worth
                    of a
                    business, using objective measures,&nbsp;and evaluating all aspects of the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A business valuation might include an analysis of the company's management, its capital
                    structure</a>, its future earnings prospects&nbsp;or the market value of its assets. The tools used
                    for
                    valuation can vary among evaluators, businesses, and industries. Common approaches to business
                    valuation include
                    a review of financial statements, discounting cash flow models&nbsp;and similar company comparisons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Valuation is also important for tax reporting. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that a
                    business is
                    valued based on its fair market value. Some tax-related events such as sale, purchase&nbsp;or
                    gifting of shares
                    of a company will be taxed depending on valuation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <p>Estimating the fair value of a business is an art and a science; there are several formal models
                        that
                        can be used, but choosing the right one and then the appropriate inputs can be somewhat
                        subjective.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h4>Special Considerations: Methods of Valuation</h4>
                <p>
                    There are numerous ways a company can be valued. You'll learn about several of these methods below.
                </p>

                <h5> 1. Market Capitalization</h5>
                <p>
                    Market
                    capitalization is the simplest method of business valuation. It is calculated by multiplying the
                    company’s share price by its total number of shares outstanding. For example, as of January 3, 2018,
                    Microsoft
                    Inc. traded at $86.35.1 With a total number of shares outstanding of 7.715 billion, the
                    company could then be valued at $86.35 x 7.715 billion = $666.19 billion.
                </p>

                <h5>2. Times Revenue Method </h5>
                <p>
                    Under the times
                    revenue business valuation method, a stream of revenues generated over a certain period of time is
                    applied to a multiplier which depends on the industry and economic environment. For example, a tech
                    company may
                    be valued at 3x revenue, while a service firm may be valued at 0.5x revenue.
                </p>
                <h5>3. Earnings Multiplier</h5>
                <p>
                    Instead of the times revenue method, the earnings multiplier may be used to get a more accurate
                    picture of the real
                    value of a company, since a company’s profits are a more reliable indicator of its financial success
                    than sales
                    revenue is. The earnings multiplier adjusts future profits against cash flow that could be invested
                    at the
                    current interest rate over the same period of time. In other words, it adjusts the current P/E ratio
                </p>
                <h5>4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method </h5>
                <p>
                    The DCF method of business valuation is
                    similar to the earnings multiplier. This method is based on projections of future cash flows, which
                    are adjusted
                    to get the current market value of the company. The main difference between the discounted cash flow
                    method and
                    the profit multiplier method is that it takes inflation into consideration to calculate the present
                    value.
                </p>
                <h5>5. Book Value</h5>
                <p>
                    This is the value of shareholders’ equity of a business as shown on the balance sheet statement. The
                    book value is derived by subtracting
                    the total liabilities of a company from its total assets.
                </p>
                <h5>6. Liquidation Value</h5>
                <p>
                    Liquidation
                    value is the net cash that a business will receive if its assets were liquidated and liabilities
                    were paid off
                    today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This&nbsp;is by no means an exhaustive list of the business valuation methods in use today. Other
                    methods
                    include replacement value, breakup value, asset-based valuation&nbsp;and still many more.
                </p>
                <h4>Accreditation in Business Valuation</h4>
                <p>
                    In the U.S., Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) is a professional designation awarded
                    to accountants such as&nbsp;CPAs who specialize in calculating the value of businesses. The ABV
                    certification is
                    overseen by the&nbsp;American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&nbsp;(AICPA) and requires
                    candidates to
                    complete an application process, pass an exam, meet minimum Business Experience and Education
                    requirements, and
                    pay a credential fee (as of 2018, the annual fee for&nbsp;the ABV Credential was $380).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintaining the ABV credential also requires those who hold the certification to meet minimum
                    standards for work
                    experience and lifelong learning. Successful applicants earn the right to use the ABV designation
                    with their
                    names, which can improve job opportunities, professional reputation and pay. In Canada, Chartered
                    Business
                    Valuator (CBV) is a professional designation
                    for&nbsp;business&nbsp;valuation&nbsp;specialists. It is offered by the Canadian Institute of
                    Chartered Business
                    Valuators (CICBV).
